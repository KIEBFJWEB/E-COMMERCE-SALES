**Description**
`
The "E-Commerce Sales" project is a comprehensive database solution designed to manage, track, and analyze sales performance for an online retail business. It efficiently organizes data related to customer orders, sales targets, and order details, enabling detailed analysis of business operations. The database consists of three core tables:

SALES_TARGET: Stores the monthly sales target for each product category, enabling businesses to set goals and measure performance.
LIST_OF_ORDERS: Captures essential order-related data, such as order ID, order date, customer information, and location details (state and city), to track customer activity and geographic trends.
ORDER_DETAILS: Contains detailed information about each order, including the product's category, sub-category, quantity, sales amount, and profit, allowing for precise sales tracking and profit analysis.
The project allows businesses to easily compare actual sales performance with set targets and provides valuable insights into sales trends by category, region, and customer behavior.
